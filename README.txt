Here are the files used in our EE40 EEG (electroencephalograph) project during the Fall 2013 semester at UC Berkeley.

Quick breakdown of the files:
 - ./eeg_project: Energia code for TI MSP430G2553 microcontroller
 - ./DS1803: DS1803 library for arduino ported to Energia IDE. (see https://github.com/zinosys/Energia-dual-i2c-potentiometer-DS1803)
 - ./KeyPad: Keypad library for arduino, imported into Energia unmodified. (see http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad)
