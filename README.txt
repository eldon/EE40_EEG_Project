Here are the files used in our EE40 EEG (electroencephalograph) project during the Fall 2013 semester at UC Berkeley.

Quick breakdown of the files:
 - eeg_project.ino: Energia code for TI MSP430G2553 microcontroller
 - ./DS1803: DS1803 library for arduino ported to Energia IDE
 - ./KeyPad: Keypad library for arduino, imported into Energia (should be unchanged from original)
